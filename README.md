# Rescue-Animal
Grazioso Salvare is a rescue animal training company that was established in 1965. We have locations in Chile, Greece, Japan, Madagascar, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We have trained thousands of dogs as rescue animals and are starting to train monkeys as well

## Our Vision
In recent years, law enforcement agencies from several countries have expressed an interest in obtaining and training rescue animals that are more capable than a traditional rescue dog.Though dogs have proven very capable, recent research indicates that primates have higher levels of attention and greater potential to perform rescue functions. To support this demand, we started training monkeys to become rescue animals. We currently have 19 monkeys of various species in the training pipeline. To date, no monkeys have been put into service as rescue animals
